# News-Driven Stock Forecasting
In this notebook we will classify whether the stocks of the company will go up or go down on the basis of the top 25 headlines about the company. We will be doing text pre-processing and then we will use LOGISTIC REGRESSION classifier, RANDOM-FOREST classifier and NAIVE BAYES classifier for the purpose of classification. We will use TF-IDF VECTORIZER to convert text into vectors.
